### Content <a name="content"></a>
Used various forums to find different apporoaches to solve problems, as sometimes this can also be confusing. Mainly [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/).
[Lucidcart](https://www.lucidchart.com/) first time using lucidchart and it was an equal training for me in the process of planning my project as to use the tool.
